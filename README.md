SNS-HDR Lightroom Plugin
========================

This is a Lightroom plugin to facilitate the use of [SNS-HDR Lite](http://www.sns-hdr.com/).
Currently there is very limited support for SNS-HDR Pro.

It has been tested with Lightroom 4 on Windows. 
SNS-HDR is Windows-only, so there is no Mac version of the plugin, sorry...

Installation & Usage
====================

**Use this plugin at your own risk, this is still experimental.**
**Make sure to have a working backup of your photos before trying this plugin.**
**Don't blame me if it eats your files!**

- Get [SNS-HDR Lite](http://www.sns-hdr.com/) (or Pro) and install it.
- Get the latest release of the plugin and unpack it.
- Use the Lightroom plugin manager to enable it.
- Use the export dialog to send your files to SNS-HDR. 
  You can configure all available options of the "Lite" version here.
